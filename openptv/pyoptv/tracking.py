Pure Python implementation of tracking algorithms.

This module provides Python implementations of the same functionality
available in the C library, serving as a fallback and development environment.

    Track particles across frames.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    particles : ndarray
        Array of shape (n, 3) containing particle positions (x, y, z)
    max_link_distance : float
        Maximum distance for linking particles
        
    Returns
    -------
    trajectories : list
        List of trajectories, where each trajectory is a list of particle indices
    
    Notes
    -----
    This is a pure Python implementation that matches the API of the Cython binding.
    It is intended for development, debugging, and as a fallback when the C library
    is not available.
